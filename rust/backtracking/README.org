#+title: Backtracking

Backtracking is a class of algorithms for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution --- Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Backtracking&oldid=1246866316
