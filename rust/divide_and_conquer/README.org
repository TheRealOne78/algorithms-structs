#+title: Divide & Conquer

In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem --- Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Divide-and-conquer_algorithm&oldid=1290360712
