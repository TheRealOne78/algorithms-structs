#+title: Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time --- Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greedy_algorithm&oldid=1296400421
